# 🌱 GreenCity – IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System

GreenCity is an **IoT-based smart irrigation system** designed for **urban public green spaces** such as parks, gardens, and roadside plantations.  
It monitors **soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time** and automatically controls irrigation to **reduce water wastage and manual effort**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Urban green spaces often suffer from:
- Over-irrigation leading to water wastage  
- Under-irrigation harming plant health  
- Lack of real-time monitoring  
- High manual labor and maintenance costs  

GreenCity solves these issues using **IoT automation and real-time data monitoring**.

## 🎯 Aim & Objectives
- Monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time  
- Automate irrigation based on soil conditions  
- Reduce water consumption  
- Enable remote monitoring via mobile/web dashboard  
- Promote sustainable and smart urban development  

---

## 🧠 System Overview
**Working Flow:**
1. Sensors collect environmental data  
2. ESP32 processes the data  
3. Data is sent to the cloud via Wi-Fi  
4. Dashboard displays real-time values  
5. System decides whether irrigation is needed  
6. Water pump turns ON/OFF automatically via relay
